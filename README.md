Use MaterialEditor to adjust the color and other parameters. 

In Studio you can enable the FK function on the Anim tab to activiate the dildo's FK nodes to rotate. Please note that it's only these bones namely _Root, Control_1, Control_2, ... and Control_6_ to rotate, and 
it suggests using MoveController to batch select them to operate. You can also search for them on the Bone tab in the adv.mode of HS2PE/AIPE to give them more specific adjustments such like position changing.

On the same tab, you can scale up or down the bones namely _deform_1, deform_2, ... and deform_6_ to make parts of the dildo bigger or smaller.
